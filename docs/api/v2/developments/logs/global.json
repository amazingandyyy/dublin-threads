    "oldVal": "The City received a preliminary application from IKEA to construct a store on a 27.5 acre site at 5144 and 5344 Martinelli Way in March 2016. Subsequently, the City held an open house in June 2016 to engage the community for feedback on the proposed project. IKEA has been working on refining the site layout and on March 16, 2017, IKEA submitted a revised site plan to the City for review. The updated preliminary plan submitted to the City can be reviewed by clicking on the thumbnail below. The initial site plan submitted in March 2016 envisioned a nearly 378,000 square foot IKEA store with surface parking, additional retail/restaurant spaces, and possibly a 75-room hotel. The revised conceptual site plan shows a proposed 339,000 square foot IKEA store with integrated podium parking and a 92,600 square foot commercial center with a mix of retail and restaurant spaces. This revised site plan is under review and is still being refined. An environmental analysis of the proposed project has begun.",

IKEA has been working on refining the site layout and on March 16, 2017, IKEA submitted a revised site plan to the City for review. The updated preliminary plan submitted to the City can be reviewed by clicking on the thumbnail below. The initial site plan submitted in March 2016 envisioned a nearly 378,000 square foot IKEA store with surface parking, additional retail/restaurant spaces, and possibly a 75-room hotel. The revised conceptual site plan shows a proposed 339,000 square foot IKEA store with integrated podium parking and a 92,600 square foot commercial center with a mix of retail and restaurant spaces. This revised site plan is under review and is still being refined. An environmental analysis of the proposed project has begun.",
